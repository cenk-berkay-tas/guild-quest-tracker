# guild-quest-tracker
A practice project that models the backend for a fictional video game. 

# TODO
- [ ] connect Player and Guild through a ManyToOne relationship.
- [ ] ensure Player and Guild names are unique.
- [ ] add other important fields to Player and Guild
- [ ] Ensure every Guild has leaders (subset of members who can start quests)
- [ ] CreateGuild API for Player (the creator of a guild is automatically a member + a leader)
- [ ] Quest API (Guild's have "quests" that are started by leaders)
- [ ] "Contribute" for Player API (so that guild members can do quests)
